# UE4-AuroraEffect
A raymarched aurora borealis effect for Unreal 4

Tested in Unreal 4.26.

Easily added as a post-process effect to any level, see demo level for usage. Material is fully commented, and the code for the custom nodes can be found in the .hlsl files in the root.

If you end up using the effect in your game, it would be nice if you credited me (though it is of course not necessary) - and do show me what you're making with it on my twitter at [@AndiJorgensen](http://twitter.com/AndiJorgensen)!
